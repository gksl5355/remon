(Added by Proposition P, 11/8/83)
SEC. 1001. PURPOSE.
Because the smoking of tobacco or any other weed or plant is a danger to health and is a cause of material annoyance and discomfort to
those who are present in confined places, the Board of Supervisors hereby declares that the purposes of this Article are (1) to protect the
public health and welfare by regulating smoking in the office workplace and (2) to minimize the toxic effects of smoking in the office
workplace by requiring an employer to adopt a policy that will accommodate, insofar as possible, the preferences of nonsmokers and
smokers and, if a satisfactory accommodation cannot be reached, to prohibit smoking in the office workplace.
This ordinance is not intended to create any right to smoke or to impair or alter an employer's prerogative to prohibit smoking in the
workplace. Rather, if an employer allows employees to smoke in the workplace, then this ordinance requires (1) that the employer make
accommodations for the preferences of both nonsmoking and smoking employees, and (2) if a satisfactory accommodation to all affected
nonsmoking employees cannot be reached, that the employer prohibit smoking in the office workplace.

The Board of Supervisors has a longstanding interest in the risks to human health of tobacco use, and disease prevention and health
promotion are essential components of this health policy. Cigarette smoking is a certifiable health danger to smokers and nonsmokers
alike. By smoking cigarettes, or being exposed to secondhand smoke, people inhale various chemicals including, for example,
formaldehyde, ammonia, tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that cigarette
smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema, and that smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury, premature
birth, and low birth weight. The Board of Supervisors desires to prevent disease and promote the health of the people of San Francisco by
making it easier for residents and visitors to avoid secondhand smoke in eating establishments. For the most part, this Article simply
extends the smoking prohibitions of Article 19 to include eating establishments.

SEC. 1007. FINDINGS.
The question of whether tobacco smoke is harmful to smokers was answered more than 20 years ago. U.S. Public Health Service
reports on the health consequences of smoking have conclusively established cigarette smoking as the largest single preventable cause of
premature death and disability in the United States. As a result many scientists began to question whether the low levels of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) received by nonsmokers could be harmful.
The 1986 Surgeon General's Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking clearly documents that nonsmokers are
placed at increased risk for developing disease as the result of ETS exposure. The term "involuntary smoking" denotes that for many
nonsmokers, exposure to ETS is the result of an unavoidable consequence of being in close proximity to smokers.
The report contains the following conclusions: (1) Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy
nonsmokers. (2) Simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, exposure
of nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke.
The quality of the indoor environment must be a concern of all who control and occupy that environment. Protection of individuals
from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is therefore a responsibility shared by all. As employers and employees we must ensure
that the act of smoking does not expose the nonsmoker to tobacco smoke. For smokers, it is their responsibility to assure that their
behavior does not jeopardize the health of others. For nonsmokers, it is their responsibility to provide a supportive environment for
smokers who are attempting to stop.
The scientific case against involuntary smoking as a health risk is more than sufficient to justify this legislative measure, the goal of
which must be to protect the nonsmoker from environmental tobacco smoke.

The provisions of this Article apply to office workplace shared by the employees of two or more employers.
(1) Each employer shall notify his or her employees of the following regulations regarding smoking:
(a) Any nonsmoking employee may object to his or her employer about smoke in the office workplace. If the objection concerns
another employer's employee, the nonsmoker's employer shall notify the smoker's employer of the objection. Using already available
means of ventilation or separation or partition of office space, the smoker's employer shall attempt to reach a reasonable accommodation,
insofar as possible, between the preferences of the nonsmoking and smoking employees. However, an employer is not required by this
ordinance to make any expenditures or structural changes to accommodate the preferences of nonsmoking or smoking employees.
(b) If an accommodation which is satisfactory to all affected nonsmoking employees cannot be reached, the preferences of
nonsmoking employees shall prevail and the employers shall prohibit smoking in that office workplace. The employers shall clearly
mark the area in which smoking is prohibited.

SEC. 1008. FINDINGS.
(a) The United States Surgeon General's 1986 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking reports the following:
(1) Involuntary smoking is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.
(2) The children of parents who smoke compared with the children of nonsmoking parents have an increased frequency of
respiratory infections, increased respiratory symptoms, and slightly smaller rates of increase in lung function as the lung matures.
(3) The simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of
nonsmokers to environmental tobacco smoke.
(b) The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:
(1) Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them when they involuntarily inhale
tobacco smoke.
(2) Regulation of smoking in public places is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of
nonsmokers.
(c) It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect the nonsmoker from environmental
tobacco smoke and to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, in public places.

person would have in establishing injury based on lost business, lost productivity due to health injuries caused by tobacco smoke, and
other costs arising because of the health problems created by smoking.
(b) Any person who violates or refuses to comply with the provisions of this Article, shall be liable for a civil penalty, not to exceed

SEC. 1009.20. FINDINGS.
(a) The United States Surgeon General's 2006 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking reports the following:
(1) Smoking is the single greatest preventable cause of disease and death.
(2) Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of chemicals known to be toxic or carcinogenic (cancer causing), including formaldehyde,
benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide.
(3) Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory
infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma. Smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their
children.
(4) Concentrations of many cancer-causing and toxic chemicals are higher in secondhand smoke than in the smoke inhaled by
smokers.
(5) Breathing secondhand smoke for even a short time can have immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and
interferes with the normal functioning of the heart, blood, and vascular systems in ways that increase the risk of a heart attack.
(6) The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.
(7) Short exposures to secondhand smoke can cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease
coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack.
(8) Secondhand smoke contains many chemicals that can quickly irritate and damage the lining of the airways. Even brief exposure
can result in upper airway changes in healthy persons and can lead to increased and more frequent asthma attacks in children who already
have asthma.
(9) Secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers.
(10) The children of parents who smoke compared with the children of nonsmoking parents have an increased frequency of
respiratory infections, increased respiratory symptoms, and slightly smaller rates of increase in lung function as the lung matures.
(11) Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke. Separating smokers from
nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke.
(b) The California Air Resources Board issued a report in January 2006 that identified secondhand smoke as a toxic air contaminant
with no safe level of exposure. Secondhand smoke has joined benzene, arsenic, and diesel exhaust on the Toxic Air Contaminant list.
According to the report:
(1) Each year in California, secondhand smoke is linked to: (A) 400 additional lung cancer deaths a year in nonsmokers; (B) 3,600
deadly heart attacks; and, (C) 31,000 asthma attacks in children.
(2) Health effects causally associated with exposure to secondhand smoke include (A) breast cancer in younger, primarilypremenopausal women; (B) asthma induction and exacerbation in children and adults; (C) pre-term delivery; and (D) altered vascular
properties associated with risk for heart attack.
(3) Concentrations of secondhand smoke in some outdoor locations can reach levels as high as indoor locations, depending on the
number of cigarettes being smoked and wind conditions.
(4) According to the 2002-2004 California Student Tobacco Survey, 49 percent of youths reported being exposed to secondhand
smoke from someone smoking in the same room during the previous seven days. According to the 2002 California Tobacco Survey, 11.9
percent of non-smoking Californian indoor workers reported having been exposed to secondhand smoke at work within the past two
weeks, with 64.7 percent exposed on a daily basis.
(5) In 2005, 13.9 percent of San Francisco adults were smokers, including 7.5 percent who were daily smokers and 6.4 percent who
were occasional smokers. "Occasional smokers" are smokers who do not smoke on a daily basis.
(c) The 2003 Final Report on Tobacco Control Successes prepared by the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at the University
of California, San Diego, for the California Department of Health Services found:
(1) 15.6 percent of Latinos, 11.3 percent of Asians, 9.5 percent of African Americans, and 10.4 percent of Whites were exposed to
secondhand smoke in indoor workplaces within two weeks of answering the survey.
(2) In the home setting, African American children and adolescents were found to have the highest rate of exposure (14.3 percent) to
secondhand smoke compared to 5.7 percent of Asians/Pacific Islanders, 8.5 percent of Latinos and 10.9 percent of Whites.
(3) Residents living in multi-unit housing complexes can be exposed to secondhand smoke that seeps from neighboring units
through doorways, electrical sockets, cracks in the sealing, shared ventilation systems, holes in wall plates and subfloor assemblies for
electrical wiring, plumbing, and ductwork.
(d) The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:
(1) Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them by secondhand smoke.
(2) Regulation of smoking in public places is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of
nonsmokers.
(e) It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and
to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, in public places, and certain residential settings.

passageways to guest rooms and suites within the same enclosed building or buildings as the guest rooms or suites.

(e) Notwithstanding Police Code Section 121(d) or any other provision of law, smoking outside entrances, exits and operable
windows and vents of all buildings is only permitted at the curb of the nearest street, sidewalk or alley. If there is no curb within fifteen
feet of the building, smoking is prohibited within fifteen feet of entrances, exits, and operable windows and vents of any building.

permitted ten feet or more away from a door or window in an outdoor common area within the perimeter, a common hall open to the
outdoors on at least one side, or courtyard of any multi-unit housing complex. Except for purposes of ingress and egress, the entry doors
of private residential units shall be closed at any time that smoking is occurring within an individual dwelling unit of either a multi-unit
housing complex or a mixed-use building where the door opens into an area where smoking is prohibited under this Section.
(g) Smoking is prohibited in all vehicles owned by the City and County of San Francisco.
(h) It is unlawful for any person to smoke in any area where this Article prohibits smoking. It is unlawful for the owner of any
property, facility or establishment subject to this Article or if a different person has the right to possession or management of such
property, facility or establishment, for that person to permit any person to smoke in any area where smoking is prohibited by this Article,
and the owner or manager had or should have had actual or constructive knowledge acquired by due diligence of the smoking. This
subsection does not require a property owner or manager of a business to enforce a smoking prohibition outside the business against
persons who are not patrons of the business, or a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex to enforce a smoking
prohibition outside the building against persons who are not tenants of the building.
(i) Any person who owns, operates or manages property is required to take the following steps to prevent smoking on that property
where it is prohibited under this Code:
(1) Post clear and prominent signs at each entrance to the premises no higher than 8 feet and no lower than 5 feet, and within 10 feet
of the door or the most appropriate place for visibility from outside, that read "Smoking only 1) at the curb, or 2) if no curb, at least 15 ft.
from entrances, exits, operable windows, and vents" in letters no less than one half inch in height and include 1) the international "No
Smoking" symbol, consisting of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette enclosed in a circle, with a diameter of at least three
inches, with a bar across it, and 2) a statement at the bottom of the sign that reads "SF Health Code Article 19F" in font no less than inch
in height. Persons that own, manage, or operate property that is LEED ("Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design") certified that
has a smoking distance requirement greater than that specified in this ordinance shall post signs conforming to all the requirements in this
Section that state that smoking only is allowed at that greater distance from the exists, entrances, and operable windows.
(2) Post clear and prominent "no smoking" signs in any area on the premises where smoking is prohibited. For multi-unit housing
complexes, the signs need only be posted in the common building lobby, common mailbox area, or common elevator.
(3) Request that any person smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited under this Article refrain from smoking. But this
subsection does not require a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex of less than 16 units to make the request that a
person refrain from smoking unless the owner or manager observes the person smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited under this
Article, nor does this subsection require a property owner or manager of a business to enforce the smoking prohibition in Section
1009.22(d) outside a business by persons who are not patrons of the business, or a property owner or manager of a multi-unit housing
complex to enforce a smoking prohibition outside the building by persons who are not tenants of the building.
Upon receipt of a written complaint from a tenant or the Department of Public Health or when any person is observed smoking
where smoking is prohibited, an owner or manager of a multi-unit housing complex must post a notice in the building lobby, common
mailbox area, or common elevator for a period of not less than ten days, advising that a tenant has been observed smoking is a portion of
the building where smoking is prohibited under San Francisco Health Code Article 19F, and requesting that all tenants refrain from
smoking in those areas. If there is no common building lobby, common mailbox area or common elevator, then the owner may provide
notice to tenants in another reasonable manner. If the owner knows the identity of the tenant who was smoking in a prohibited area, the
owner must additionally make the request to the tenant in writing, and keep a record of the request for a reasonable period of time. For
purposes of this subsection, a request that someone refrain from smoking does not require the physical ejectment of a person from the
premises.
(4) Notify existing tenants of a multi-unit housing complex, within 90 days of the effective date of this legislation, of the smoking
prohibitions contained in this Article.
(5) Remove any ashtrays from inside the premises. No persons, employer, business or non profit entity shall knowingly or
intentionally permit the presence or placement of ash receptacles within an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited.
The duties described in Sections (1)-(5) of this Section are baseline requirements and are not the only responsibilities of owners or
managers to prevent smoking in multi-unit housing complexes.
(j) Violation of any part of this Article is not grounds for eviction of residential tenants.
(k) If the owner or manager has complied with all the requirements in this Article, smoking in a multi-unit housing complex where
prohibited under this Article shall not be considered a substantial reduction in housing services that would qualify a tenant for a reduction
in rent under San Francisco Administrative Code Chapter 37.(Added by Ord. 249-94, App. 7/7/94; amended by Ord. 266-99, File No. 991462, App. 10/22/99; Ord. 68-06, File No. 051669, App. 4/20/2006; Ord. 312-08, File No. 081009,

SEC. 1009.23. EXCEPTIONS.
The following places shall not be subject to this Article 19F:
(a) Tourist lodging facility room accommodations designated as smoking rooms, provided that the owners or managers of tourist
lodging facilities shall designate at least 75 percent of the guest rooms in tourist lodging facilities as smoke free. The owners or managers
of tourist lodging facilities must permanently designate particular guest rooms as smoke free and ashtrays and matches are to be
permanently removed from such smoke free rooms. "No smoking" signage shall be displayed in smoke free rooms. Where possible,
designated smoke free rooms shall not be located on the same floor as smoking rooms. It is recommended that smoking be relegated to
the top floor with at least 50 percent of the rooms on the top floor designated as smoke free. Owners and managers of tourist lodging
facilities may designate 100% of guest rooms as smoke free; if such 100% smoke free designation is made, "no smoking" signage shall
only be required in the common areas on each floor of such tourist lodging facilities.
(b) Private homes, including but not limited to dwelling units, but not the common areas, of multi-unit housing complexes and mixed-
use buildings.
(c) Bars and Taverns located in commercial buildings that submit to the Director within three months of the effective date of this
ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that the bar or tavern had no employees as of
December 31, 2009. If the Director approves the application under the criteria of this subsection, the bar or tavern may allow smoking on
the premises but must immediately 1) notify the Director if the establishment hires any employees, and 2) submit all documents to the
Director verifying eligibility for this exemption upon request. The exemption will continue for as long as the establishment has no
employees and the building where the bar or tavern is located continues to be commercial. Bars and Taverns located in mixed-use
buildings that 1) have no employees as of December 31, 2009, and 2) relocate to a commercial building within two years of the effective
date of this ordinance may allow smoking in their establishment after relocation to a commercial building if they submit to the Director
within three months of the effective date of this ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that
the bar or tavern had no employees as of December 31, 2009. The application must also document that the Bar or Tavern will be located
in a commercial building within two years of the effective date of this ordinance. This exemption status immediately expires if the
establishment hires employees, or is no longer located in a commercial building.
(d) Bars and Taverns located in commercial buildings that submit to the Director within three months of the effective date of this
ordinance an application and all documents required by the Director to demonstrate that an area in the establishment is a historically
compliant semi-enclosed smoking room and qualified as such as of December 31, 2009. If the Director denies the application because
the Bar or Tavern does not comply with the above requirements, the Director may allow the establishments to make alterations to comply
with this requirement; if the Bar or Tavern completes the alterations to the Director's satisfaction, the Director may approve the
application. If the Director approves the application under the criteria of this subsection, the Bar or Tavern may allow smoking in the
historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room. This exemption status is nontransferable and immediately expires if 1) there is a
change in the ownership interest(s) of the Bar or Tavern, 2) the room no longer meets the definition of historically compliant semi-
enclosed smoking room, 3) there are structural alterations made to the smoking room after December 31, 2009 not approved by the
Director, or 4) the establishment is no longer located in a commercial building. If the Director approves the application under the criteria
of this subsection, the Bar or Tavern may allow smoking in the historically compliant semi-enclosed smoking room but must
immediately notify the Director of any changes that would disqualify the establishment from this exemption. For purposes of this
subsection, the term "change in ownership interest(s)" means the aggregate change of 50 percent or more of the ownership of the
business within a 12-month period.
(e) Tobacco Shops that are located in commercial buildings as of December 31, 2009. To qualify for the exemption under this
Section, the tobacco shop owner must submit an application and all documents required by the Director. If the Director approves the
application, the tobacco shop may allow smoking on the premises. The exemption will continue for as long as the establishment
continues to qualify as a tobacco shop and the building where the tobacco shop is located continues to be commercial. The tobacco shop
must immediately notify the Director of any change that would disqualify the retailer from this exemption and submit all documents to
the Director verifying eligibility upon request.
(f) Medicinal Cannabis Retailers, Cannabis Microbusinesses, and Cannabis Retailers that have received and maintain:
(1) A Cannabis Business Permit issued by the Director of the Office of Cannabis under Article 16 of the Police Code; and
(2) A Cannabis Consumption Permit that authorizes the smoking of cannabis, issued by the Director of Health under Article 8A of
the Health Code, unless the smoking of cannabis is authorized under subsection (g) of Section 8A.4, pending the approval or denial of an
application for such permit.

the provisions of this Article and for assessment and recovery of a civil penalty for such violation and (2) the owner of the premises or
the person with the right to possession and management of the property may maintain an action for injunctive relief to enforce the
provisions of this Article and an action for damages. Damages may be awarded up to $500 a day for each day the violation occurs or is
permitted to continue. It is necessary to specify the amount of such damages because of the extreme difficulty that the owner or other
authorized person would have in establishing injury based on lost business, lost productivity due to health injuries caused by tobacco
smoke, and other costs arising because of the health problems created by smoking. Any civil penalties collected under this Article shall
be credited to the Public Health Environmental Health Code Compliance Fund, authorized by San Francisco Administrative Code
Section 10.100-193.
(b) Administrative Enforcement. The Director also may enforce the provisions of this Article by:

the Notice of Violation is mailed. At the hearing, the person cited with violating the provisions of this Article shall be provided an
opportunity to refute all evidence against him or her. The Director shall oversee the hearing and issue a ruling within 20 days of its
conclusion. The Director's ruling shall be final; or,
(2) Issuing a citation under San Francisco Administrative Code Chapter 100, "Procedures Governing the Imposition of
Administrative Fines," which is hereby incorporated in its entirety and shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review
of administrative citations issued to enforce this Article, and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this Article, in addition to the
other enforcement mechanisms authorized by this Article, provided, however, that:
(i) Each day a violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate violation;
(ii) The Director of Public Health shall appoint the hearing officer to conduct hearings for appeals;
(iii) The fine for any violation issued pursuant to this section shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San
Francisco and credited to the Public Health Environmental Health Code Compliance Fund, authorized by San Francisco Administrative

this Section and authorized under this Article; and,
(v) The penalty amounts for citations issued under Administrative Code Chapter 100 shall be the same as those set forth in
subsection (c).
(c) Any person who violates or refuses to comply with the provisions of this Article shall be liable for a civil or administrative penalty
in the amounts set forth in Cal. Labor Code Sec. 6404.5 for each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue. A civil penalty
shall be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the City and County of San Francisco, by the City
Attorney, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any penalty assessed and recovered in a civil or administrative action brought pursuant
to this Section shall be paid to the Treasurer of the City and County of San Francisco and credited to the Public Health Environmental
Health Code Compliance Fund. An administrative penalty shall be assessed following an administrative hearing as described in
subsection (b).

law pertaining to smoking shall be liable to the City for costs incurred in abating the effects of the violation, taking other remedial action,
or imposing and collecting penalties, including but not limited to administrative costs, costs of issuing an order, inspection costs, hearing
officer costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees. The Controller's Office shall set the amount of actual costs, based on an accounting

The hearing officer shall require in any order issued under this Section that the responsible party pay to the City the costs of any
inspection or monitoring deemed necessary by the Hearing Officer because of the violation.

(a) All final costs, fees, and administrative or civil penalties assessed against a person for violations of this Article shall be an
obligation owed to the City by the person found to have violated State or local laws pertaining to smoking. Such obligation may be
collected by means of the imposition of a lien against the property of the person or business against whom the final administrative or civil
penalty was assessed, provided the violation occurred on that property. The City shall mail to the owner of the property a notice of the
amounts due and a warning that lien proceedings will be initiated against the property if the amounts are not paid within 30 days after

things that are required, directed or expressly authorized by federal or state law. Further, in adopting this Article, the Board of
Supervisors does not intend to prohibit that which is prohibited by federal or state law. It is the intent of the Board of Supervisors that the

SEC. 19H.1. FINDINGS.
The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco hereby finds and declares as follows:
(a) Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and kills nearly 6 million people each year globally (World
Health Organization 2013). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 400,000 deaths in the United
States each year are attributable to tobacco use, including one-third of all cancer deaths.
(b) In addition to the obvious adverse health impact, tobacco related death and disease have an adverse economic impact. The CDC
reports that tobacco use costs the United States billions of dollars each year.
(c) State law prohibits the sale or furnishing of cigarettes, tobacco products and smoking paraphernalia to minors, as well as the
purchase, receipt, or possession of tobacco products by minors. (California Penal Code section 308.) State law also prohibits public
school students from smoking or using tobacco products while on campus, attending school-sponsored activities, or under the
supervision or control of school district employees. (California Education Code section 48901(a).) In addition, state law prohibits
smoking in enclosed places of employment (California Labor Code section 6404.5). Moreover, San Francisco has adopted ordinances
that ban cigarette vending machines in the City (Health Code Article 19D), prohibit pharmacy sales of Tobacco Products (Health Code
Article 19J), prohibit the self-service merchandising of Tobacco Products, except in places to which access by minors is prohibited by
law (Police Code Section 4600.3), prohibit smoking in enclosed areas and sports stadiums (Health Code Article 19F) and prohibit the use
of electronic cigarettes where smoking is not allowed (Health Code Article 19N).
(d) Despite these state and local restrictions, minors continue to obtain cigarettes and other Tobacco Products at alarming rates. 36.8%
of California youth have smoked an entire cigarette by age 14 according to a 2012 survey conducted by the California Department of
Public Health. The former United States Surgeon General Regina Benjamin at a February 2014 summit emphasized that the key factor in
the fight against tobacco is preventing minors from becoming smokers. She noted, "for every smoker who dies, there are two so-called
replacement smokers trying a cigarette for the first time and getting hooked."
(e) Although it is unlawful to sell Tobacco Products and/or tobacco paraphernalia to minors, in a 2013 California youth buying
survey, 7.6% of retailers surveyed unlawfully sold Tobacco Products to minors. These percentages are more concerning locally. San
Francisco's Tobacco Sales to minors were reported to be 13.4% of retailers in 2012. Notably, sales in the City to minors are well above
the 2012 statewide sales rate of 8.7%. More aggressive policies are needed to keep San Francisco's youth from gaining access to Tobacco
Products.
(f) There are approximately 1,001 outlets in San Francisco that are licensed to sell tobacco, that is about 1 retailer for every 111 youth
in the community compared to California generally where there are approximately 36,700 licensed tobacco retail stores in California –
one for every 254 youth.
(g) San Francisco has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with State laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and Tobacco
Products to minors, in promoting compliance with laws intended to discourage the purchase of Tobacco Products by minors, and in
protecting our children from illegally obtained tobacco.
(h) Social norms about smoking influence smoking rates, particularly among those not addicted. Studies have found that strong
governmental regulation of smoking corresponds with and may contribute to anti-smoking norms. Social unacceptability has been
repeatedly shown to be an important influence on both smoking rates and anti-smoking norms. Children and young people are
particularly influenced by cues suggesting smoking is acceptable.
(i) Empirical research connects lower densities of retail outlets with lower consumption of tobacco, particularly among youth. Higher
tobacco retail density encourages smoking by making cigarettes more accessible and available, by normalizing tobacco use, and through
increasing environmental cues to smoke. Research focused on California has found a higher prevalence of current smoking and
experimental smoking among students at schools in areas with a higher density of tobacco outlets. Prevalence of smoking was higher
among students at schools in neighborhoods with five or more stores that sell tobacco than among students at schools in neighborhoods
without any stores that sell tobacco.
(j) California communities in lower socioeconomic areas with a higher concentration of convenience stores have significantly higher
rates of smoking. Residents of these neighborhoods are more at risk for tobacco related disease and death. Likewise, San Francisco'smost disadvantaged neighborhoods are disproportionately impacted by high tobacco retail density. The six supervisorial districts with the
highest proportions of tobacco retail sales by population (Districts 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11) also have the lowest median household incomes
in the City. District Six, with a median household income of $38,610, has 270 tobacco permits while District Two, with a median
household income of $102,457, has only 51 tobacco permits. African American and Latino residents are more likely to live in districts
with the highest number of tobacco retail outlets.
(k) As the tobacco related public health crisis affects all supervisorial districts in San Francisco, it is in the City's interest to reduce the
disproportionate exposure to tobacco outlets that exists among supervisorial districts and to minimize exposure in all supervisorial
districts by limiting the number of new tobacco permits issued. District Seven currently has the lowest number (37) of tobacco permitted
retailers in San Francisco. Setting a cap slightly above the District Seven density of permitted tobacco retailers as the maximum for each
supervisorial district will begin to address the disparity of exposure to tobacco outlets among supervisorial districts and reduce the
density of tobacco vendors overall.
(l) San Franciscans support limiting and reducing the number of permits for the sale of tobacco. In a 2012 representative survey of
over 220 San Francisco residents, 88.5% felt that too many stores selling cigarettes is bad for community health; almost 74% would
support a law that very gradually reduces the number of stores selling cigarettes and Tobacco Products given that the highest density of
these is in low income neighborhoods; and 87% would support a policy that would reduce the amount of Tobacco Products available.
(m) Restaurants, and other non-traditional tobacco retailers in California are more likely to sell tobacco to minors than other retailers.
13.1% percent of restaurants and other nontraditional retailers sold tobacco to minors compared to 8.7% of all other California retailers.
(n) Young adult Bar patrons in one California study reported a current smoking rate of 47 percent, nearly four times the 2010 state
rate of smoking prevalence for young adults.
(o) Social environments such as Bars and clubs are important venues for public health efforts to address young adult smoking.
(p) This Article 19H is designed to promote the public interest in ensuring that San Francisco businesses operate in compliance with
applicable laws regulating tobacco, including laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors and laws regulating smoking.

SEC. 19H.3. REQUIREMENT FOR TOBACCO SALES PERMIT.
It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in tobacco sales, or to allow tobacco sales, in any establishment without first obtaining
and maintaining a valid tobacco sales permit from the Department for each location where tobacco sales are conducted. Nothing in this
Article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco sales permit any status or right other than the right to
act as a tobacco retailer at the location identified on the face of the permit. The obtaining of a permit does not in and of itself transform a
business into a retail tobacco or wholesale shop within the meaning of California Labor Code section 6404.5. It shall be unlawful for any
person to engage in tobacco sales, or to allow tobacco sales, at an establishment for which the Director has suspended the tobacco sales
while the period of suspension remains in effect. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in or allow tobacco sales at an
establishment for which the Director has revoked the tobacco sales permit for three years from the date of revocation. Permits are valid
as long as the annual license fees are paid.

Tobacco Sales are to be permitted. The Director may also ask the Applicant to provide additional information that is reasonably related
to the determination whether a permit may issue.
(c) Referral to the Planning Department. The Director will then refer Applications requiring inspection as to proximity to Schools
and existing Establishments to the Planning Department. The Planning Department upon referral shall analyze the Application against

Equalization where the Applicant is required to have the State Board of Equalization permit except for businesses selling only electronic
cigarettes.
(3) No new permit shall be issued if the Applicant will be within 500 feet of the nearest point of the property line of a School as
measured by a straight line from the nearest point of the property line on which a School is located to the nearest point of the property
line on which the Applicant's Establishment will be located.

SEC. 19H.5. DENSITY CAP.
(a) The Density Cap shall be forty-five (45) permitted Tobacco Sales Establishments in a supervisorial district. The Department shall
assess the Density Cap every two years to evaluate whether to recommend to the Board of Supervisors an amendment to this Article to
change the number of permitted Establishments as reasonably necessary to advance the public health purposes this Article seeks to
achieve. The City may not issue a new permit in any supervisorial district that is at or above the Density Cap at the time of submission of
the Application.
(b) Pursuant to its authority under Section 19H.26 to adopt rules, the Department may adopt rules governing the approval process for

PROHIBITING SMOKING AT CERTAIN OUTDOOR EVENTS
Sec. 19L.1. Findings.
Sec. 19L.2. Definitions.
Sec. 19L.3. Prohibiting Smoking at Certain Outdoor Events.
Sec. 19L.4. Violations.
SEC. 19L.1. FINDINGS.
(a) The United States Surgeon General's 2006 Report on the Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking provides the following:
(1) Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease,
and lung cancer.
(2) Secondhand smoke is responsible for as many as 3,000 deaths from lung cancer and 46,000 deaths from heart disease among
nonsmokers each year in the United States.
(3) Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory
infections, ear problems, and more severe asthma.
(4) Scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.
(b) According to several studies conducted measuring the tobacco smoke concentrations in various outdoor settings:
(1) Levels of secondhand smoke exposure outdoors can reach levels attained indoors depending on direction and amount of wind, as
well as the number and proximity of smokers.
(2) Irritation from secondhand smoke begins at levels as low as 4 micrograms per cubic meter. In some situations this level can be
found as far away as 13 feet from the burning cigarette.
(3) To be completely free from exposure to secondhand smoke in outdoor places, a person may have to move nearly 25 feet away
from the source of the smoke, about the width of a two lane road.
(4) Studies on a cruise ship found that even while cruising at 20 knots and with unlimited air volume, outdoor smoking areas
contained carcinogens in nearly the same amounts as inside the ship's casino where smoking was allowed.
(c) According to the 2009 California Health Interview Survey, creating smoke free areas helps protect the health of the 88.4% of San
Franciscans who are nonsmokers.
(d) According to the 2008 Study of California Voters' Attitudes About Secondhand Smoke Exposure found that 75% thought that
secondhand smoke is harmful, 64% were bothered by secondhand smoke, 73% support laws restricting smoking at outdoor public
places, and people living in cities with strong smoke free air laws are more likely to believe smoking is not acceptable and that smokers
should attempt to quit smoking.
(e) A 2011 Opinion Survey conducted at seven street events in San Francisco from August to October, found that out of the almost
600 surveys collected: 67% favored making all street events in San Francisco smoke-free and 58.9% have been bothered by secondhand
smoke at street events.
(f) According to the California Clean Air Project, California Secondhand Smoke Policy Database, as of 2008, there were 187
California cities and counties with local laws restricting smoking in at least one outdoor area.
(g) The Board of Supervisors finds and declares:(1) Nonsmokers have no adequate means to protect themselves from the damage inflicted upon them by secondhand smoke.
(2) Regulation of smoking at outdoor events is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare, comfort, and environment of
nonsmokers.
(3) It is, therefore, the intent of the Board of Supervisors, in enacting this Article, to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke
and to eliminate smoking, as much as possible, at certain outdoor events.

Sec. 19N.7. Rules and Regulations.
Sec. 19N.8. Preemption.
Sec. 19N.9. Severability.
SEC. 19N.1. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
(a) Electronic smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, are battery-operated devices that may
resemble cigarettes, although they do not contain tobacco leaf. People who use electronic smoking devices inhale vaporized liquid
nicotine extracted from tobacco, or inhale other vaporized liquids, created by heat through an electronic ignition system, and exhale the
vapor in a way that mimics smoking.
(b) Electronic cigarettes are presently available for purchase and use in San Francisco.
(c) The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of Compliance purchased two samples of electronic cigarettes and
components from two leading brands. These samples included 18 of the various flavored, nicotine, and no-nicotine cartridges offered for
use with these products. These cartridges were obtained to test some of the ingredients contained in them and inhaled by users of
electronic cigarettes. The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis (DPA) analyzed thecartridges from these electronic cigarettes for nicotine content and for the presence of other tobacco constituents, some of which are
known to be harmful to humans, including those that are potentially carcinogenic or mutagenic. The DPA's analysis of the electronic
cigarette samples showed:
(1) The products contained detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals to which users could be exposed.
(2) Quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or non-existent.
(3) Tobacco-specific impurities suspected of being harmful to humans – anabasine, myosmine, and β-nicotyrine – were detected in a
majority of the samples tested.
(4) Three different electronic cigarette cartridges with the same label were tested and each cartridge emitted a markedly different
amount of nicotine with each puff. The nicotine levels per puff ranged from 26.8 to 43.2 mcg nicotine/100 mL puff.
(d) The Surgeon General has found that the chemical nicotine is a powerful pharmacologic agent that acts in the brain and throughout
the body and is highly addictive. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that nicotine is as
addictive as cocaine or heroin and is a highly toxic substance. Use of nicotine in any form may cause or contribute to cardiovascular
disease, complications of hypertension, reproductive disorders, cancers of many types, and gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic
ulcer disease and gastro esophageal reflux.
(e) The FDA has raised concerns that electronic cigarettes, including but not limited to flavored electronic cigarettes, can increase
nicotine addiction among young people and may lead youth to try conventional tobacco products. A CDC study showed that in 2011
4.7% of all high schoolers had tried e-cigarettes and that in 2012 that number increased to 10.0% of all high schoolers. Electronic
cigarettes may not be legally sold to minors in California. Electronic smoking devices and other unapproved nicotine delivery products
have a high appeal to youth due to their high tech design and availability in child-friendly flavors like cotton candy, bubble gum,
chocolate chip cookie dough and cookies and cream milkshake.
(f) Health authorities have also expressed concerns that the vapors released into the air through the use of an electronic cigarette
present a danger to others who breathe them.
(g) The use of an electronic cigarette in public is often indistinguishable from the use of traditional tobacco products, prompting
confusion among members of the public wherever smoking is prohibited. Consequently, persons who smoke traditional tobacco products
may be induced to do so in areas where smoking is illegal under the mistaken belief that smoking is legal in such areas, or that the ban on
smoking in such areas is not being enforced.
(h) Owners of establishments such as office buildings and restaurants encounter similar obstacles seeking to comply with the laws
prohibiting smoking in certain locations. An owner may request that a patron stop smoking cigarettes in a restaurant only to have the
patron demonstrate that it is an electronic cigarette. The Owner may also be placed in the position of having to confront and examine the
cigarettes of any number of customers absent a prohibition on the use of electronic cigarettes where traditional cigarettes are banned.
(i) The agencies charged with enforcing compliance in enclosed and unenclosed spaces will similarly have to devote considerable
time and resources determining the individuals smoking electronic cigarettes versus traditional cigarettes.
(j) Some agencies in San Francisco have already adopted restrictions on e-cigarette usage including San Francisco General Hospital,
Laguna Honda Hospital, AT&T Ballpark, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco Department of Public Health and the
San Francisco International Airport.

VENUES]

SEC. 19O.1. FINDINGS.
Public health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the National Cancer Institute, have found that smokeless tobacco use is
hazardous to health and can easily lead to nicotine addiction. The National Cancer Institute states that chewing tobacco and snuff contain
28 cancer-causing agents and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has established smokeless tobacco as a "known human carcinogen."
The National Cancer Institute and the International Agency for Research on Cancer report that use of smokeless tobacco causes oral,
pancreatic, and esophageal cancer; and may also cause heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions other than cancer, such as leukoplakia
(precancerous white patches in the mouth).
Youth participation in sports has many health benefits including the development of positive fitness habits, reducing obesity, and
combating the epidemic of early onset diabetes. 45 percent of all American youth play in an agency-sponsored sports league such as
Little League baseball or Pop Warner football – that figure represents 22 million children each year who are influenced by actively
participating in organized sporting events.
But youth players and spectators are also vulnerable to developing a potentially deadly habit, the use of smokeless tobacco. Smokeless
tobacco is strongly associated with playing sports particularly with a legacy of decades of association with baseball through marketing
tie-ins and regular use of the product by players. In a 2012 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that
"Athletes serve as role models for youth, and smokeless tobacco manufacturers have used advertising, images, and testimonials featuring
athletes and sports to make smokeless tobacco products appear attractive to youth. Children and teens closely observe athletes' actions,
including their use of tobacco products, and are influenced by what they see. Adolescents tend to mimic the behaviors of those they look
up to and identify with, including baseball players and other athletes."
In a letter to former Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig following the 2014 death of baseball icon Tony Gwynn due to
salivary gland cancer, nine leading health care organizations, including the American Medical Association, American Cancer Society,
American Lung Association, American Heart Association, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and American Dental Association, stated
that, "Use of smokeless tobacco endangers the health of major league ballplayers. It also sets a terrible example for the millions of young
people who watch baseball at the ballpark or on TV and often see players and managers using tobacco."
Professional and college football players as well as those participating in wrestling, ice hockey, and lacrosse also have been shown to
use smokeless tobacco products at high rates.
The CDC Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance Report found that nationally 14.7% of high-school boys and 8.8 % of all high-school
students reported using smokeless products in 2013. In San Francisco, 3.3% of high-school students reported current use of smokeless
tobacco in 2013. Each year, about 415,000 kids nationally ages 12-17 use smokeless tobacco for the first time.
Smokeless tobacco products are heavily advertised and promoted, with the top five smokeless tobacco companies in the U.S. more than
tripling their total advertising and marketing expenditures from 1998 to 2011. The Federal Trade Commission reports that in 2011, these
smokeless tobacco companies spent $451.7 million to advertise and promote their products.
Flavored tobacco products are known to be attractive to youth and flavored smokeless tobacco products have increased in the market
72% between 2005 and 2011, and contributed to 59.4% of total growth of the smokeless tobacco market. Smokeless tobacco products are
viewed by young adults positively because they come in flavors and in attractive packaging, and are promoted as recreational,
convenient, concealed, modern, and fun.
Tobacco use has been prohibited in minor league baseball games since 1993 and in the National Collegiate Athletic Association since
1994 (which also adopted a zero-tolerance policy in 2002); the Little League World Series is tobacco-free, and the San Francisco
Unified School District policies prohibit use of tobacco, including smokeless tobacco, during athletic events by players and coaches
since 1996. Nearly 1,000 college campuses nationwide are tobacco-free. Research shows that students, faculty, and staff looking to stop
their nicotine habits are more likely to do so in an environment that prohibits all tobacco use.
The entire University of California system (10 campuses) is tobacco-free and smoke-free, including athletic fields and stadiums.
Sacramento State University, Santa Clara University, and San Jose State University all have plans in place to become tobacco-free
during 2015.
The following Major League Baseball stadiums have instituted various forms of tobacco-free policies: the Milwaukee Brewers at
Miller Park, Saint Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium, the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, and the Cleveland Indians at Progressive
Field. AT&T Park in San Francisco is a smoke-free facility in accordance with Article 19F of the Health Code, which prohibits smoking
anywhere in the ballpark, including vaporized e-cigarette smoking. Major League Baseball publically supports banning the use of
smokeless tobacco products as a means of protecting the health of their players and youth.Use of smokeless tobacco can also interfere with the enjoyment of spectators and others using sports fields. Users of two forms of
smokeless tobacco, snuff and chewing tobacco, let the tobacco sit in their mouth while they suck on the tobacco juices, spitting often to
get rid of the saliva that builds up, creating unsightly and offensive conditions for others.
Research supports that changing policy, environment, and social norms regarding smokeless tobacco use can positively influence
young people and reduce use. Coaches and players at all levels, especially professionals, can become positive role-models to young
players by reducing and/or ceasing their use, reinforcing existing smokeless tobacco bans, and participating in educating youth on the
health risks of smokeless tobacco.

SEC. 19P.1. FINDINGS.
Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 people each year. It is
known to cause cancer, heart disease, and respiratory diseases, among other health disorders.
Each day, 700 children under the age of 18 become regular, daily smokers; and almost one-third will eventually die from smoking. If
current trends continue, 5.6 million of today's youth will die prematurely from a smoking-related illness.
According to a 2014 Report by the United States Surgeon General, cigarette smoking today is even more dangerous than previously
thought. Cigarette smoking has been linked to disease of nearly all organs of the body.
The adverse health effects of tobacco use are not limited to smoking. The National Cancer Institute and the International Agency for
Research on Cancer report that use of smokeless tobacco causes oral, pancreatic, and esophageal cancer; and may also cause heart
disease, gum disease, and oral lesions other than cancer, such as leukoplakia (precancerous white patches in the mouth).
Further, electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes) also present significant health risks. E-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly
addictive neurotoxin. Exposure to nicotine during adolescence can harm brain development and predispose youth to future tobacco use.
In addition, electronic cigarette aerosol has been found to contain at least ten chemicals that are on California's Proposition 65 list of
chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm.
In addition to the adverse health impacts of tobacco use, the treatment of tobacco-related diseases adds tremendous costs, in the billionsof dollars, to this country's health care system. A 2014 report by the University of California, San Francisco estimated that in 2009, the
cost of smoking in San Francisco amounted to over $380 million, including direct health care costs and indirect costs from lost
productivity due to illness and premature death.
State law prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 18. In spite of the ban on sales to minors, and numerous
other tobacco control policies implemented at the federal, state, and local levels, 63% of smokers in California start smoking by age 18.
National data show that 95% of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21.
In San Francisco, almost 2.7% of middle school and 9.1% of high school students smoke. The highest rate of smoking is among San
Francisco's young adults (ages 18-24), 15.8% of whom smoke.
State law also bans the sale of electronic cigarettes to minors. In spite off this ban, preliminary data of more than 430,000 middle and
high school students from the California Healthy Kids Survey found that in 2013, 6.3% of 7th graders, 12.4% of 9th graders, and 14.3%
of 11th graders had used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. Among young adults (18 to 29 years old), e-cigarette use tripled in only one
year, from 2.3% to 7.6%.
A 2005 study based on data from the California Tobacco Survey, a large, population-based telephone survey, found that 82% of
adolescents who had ever smoked obtained their cigarettes from others, mostly friends. A substantial percentage (40.9%) of the people
giving the cigarettes were 18 years or older, with most of them (31.3%) being 18, 19, or 20. Adolescents who were 16 or 17 were
especially likely to get their cigarettes from persons aged 18 through 20.
In 2015, the Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, concluded that raising
the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products nationwide would reduce tobacco initiation, particularly among adolescents aged 15
through 17, improve health across the lifespan, and save lives; and that raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products
nationwide to 21 would, over time, lead to a 12% decrease in the overall smoking rate.
The Institute of Medicine also has predicted that raising the minimum legal sales age for tobacco products nationwide to 21 would
result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for people born
in the United States between 2000 and 2019, and would result in near-immediate reductions in preterm births, low birth weight babies,
and sudden infant death syndrome.
Raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products is likely to have a similar effect as has raising the legal drinking age to 21,
which has led to reduced alcohol use and dependence among persons under 21. This Article 19P will likely result in less smoking and
tobacco use among San Franciscans under 18 and San Franciscans under 21, sparing people within both age groups from the ravages that
develop over time from harmful and highly addictive tobacco products.

Editor’s Note:
This Article, comprising Sections 19Q.1 – 19Q.8, was added by Ord.1 40-17, approved July 7, 2017, then suspended by the filing of a referendum petition. As part of
Proposition E, it was adopted by the voters at the June 5, 2018 election, and became effective 30 days after the election results were declared.
SEC. 19Q.1. FINDINGS.
(a) Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 people each year. It
causes or contributes to many forms of cancer, as well as heart disease and respiratory diseases, among other health disorders. Tobacco
use remains a public health crisis of the first order, in terms of the human suffering and loss of life it causes, the financial costs it
imposes on society, and the burdens it places on our health care system. The financial cost of tobacco use in San Francisco alone
amounts to $380 million per year in direct health care expenses and lost productivity.
(b) Flavored tobacco products are commonly sold by California tobacco retailers. For example: 97.4% of stores that sell cigarettes sell
menthol cigarettes; 94.5% of stores that sell little cigars sell them in flavored varieties; 84.2% of stores that sell electronic smoking
devices sell flavored varieties; and 83.8% of stores that sell chew or snus sell flavored varieties. 70% of tobacco retailers within 1,000
feet of San Francisco schools sell flavored tobacco products other than menthol cigarettes, and nearly all sell menthol cigarettes.
(c) Each day, about 2,500 children in the United States try their first cigarette; and another 400 children under 18 years of age become
new regular, daily smokers. 81% of youth who have ever used a tobacco product report that the first tobacco product they used was
flavored. Flavored tobacco products promote youth initiation of tobacco use and help young occasional smokers to become daily smokers
by reducing or masking the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke and thereby increasing the appeal of tobacco products. As
tobacco companies well know, menthol, in particular, cools and numbs the throat to reduce throat irritation and make the smoke feel
smoother, making menthol cigarettes an appealing option for youth who are initiating tobacco use. Tobacco companies have used
flavorings such as mint and wintergreen in smokeless tobacco products as part of a “graduation strategy” to encourage new users to start
with tobacco products with lower levels of nicotine and progress to products with higher levels of nicotine. It is therefore unsurprising
that young people are much more likely to use menthol-, candy- and fruit-flavored tobacco products, including not just cigarettes but also
cigars, cigarillos, and hookah tobacco, than adults. Data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey indicate that more than two-fifths of
U.S. middle school and high school smokers report using flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes. Further, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has reported a more than 800% increase in electronic cigarette use among middle school and high school studentsbetween 2011 and 2015. Nicotine solutions, which are consumed via electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes, are sold in
thousands of flavors that appeal to youth, such as cotton candy and bubble gum.
(d) Much as young people disproportionately use flavored tobacco products including menthol cigarettes, the same can be said of
certain minority groups. In one survey, the percentage of people who smoke cigarettes that reported smoking menthol cigarettes in the
prior month included, most dramatically, 82.6% of Blacks or African-Americans who smoke cigarettes. The statistics for other groups
were: 53.2% of Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders who smoke cigarettes; 36.9% of individuals with multiracial backgrounds
who smoke cigarettes; 32.3% of Hispanics or Latinos who smoke cigarettes; 31.2% of Asians who smoke cigarettes; 24.8% of American
Indians or Alaska Natives who smoke cigarettes; and 23.8% of Whites or Caucasians who smoke cigarettes. People who identify as
LGBT and young adults with mental health conditions also struggle with disproportionately high rates of menthol cigarette use. The
disproportionate use of menthol cigarettes among targeted groups, especially the extremely high use among African-Americans, is
troubling because of the long-term adverse health impacts on those groups.
(e) Between 2004 and 2014, overall smoking prevalence decreased, but use of menthol cigarettes increased among both young adults
(ages 18-25) and other adults (ages 26+). These statistics are consistent with the finding that smoking menthol cigarettes reduces the
likelihood of successfully quitting smoking. Scientific modeling has projected that a national ban on menthol cigarettes could save
between 300,000 and 600,000 lives by 2050.
